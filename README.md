# FootballManager
The FootballManager application is used to store information about managers of individual players
and about the players themselves. 
This data can be modified and deleted.
Additionally, we have access to information on meetings between managers and players.
The entire application is secured with a login window that saves incorrectly entered login data for security purposes.

The project has 6 tables and 3 wpf windows.
There are relational databases in the project.

Technologies used:
User interface:WPF windows
Project ORM: Entity Framework
Local database

Credits: I owe the project to Indian YouTubers.

PS. The design is primitive and is still under development, therefore for help purposes, or
